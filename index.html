				Hi There! Welcome to my portfolio. Glad you could make it. My name is Kevin. I'm 34 years old and originally from Berkeley, CA. For the last 10 years I've been working in the Bicycle Retail Industry and it's time for something new! A friend of mine who lives here in Sacramento referred me to Web Development. He tried to get me to learn on my own, and I just plain didn't have the self discipline. So, I am here with you all at Boot Camp to get serious. A few other random facts about myself...I love riding bikes and skateboarding to and fro. Biggest musical influence on my life is Bob Dylan. I earned a BA in Modern Literature from UCSC. Oh, and my fiance and I are renovating a 90 year old duplex by ourselves. It's been the hardest thing we've ever done.</p>
